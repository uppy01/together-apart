"Football in the park","Last night we went out as a family to take our dog for a walk around the neighborhood. We finished up back at the local oval near our house. While there our 11 year oid son saw one of his mates from school kicking a football with his mum. He wandered over and the two boys started passing the ball and chatting (whilst always maintaining sufficient physical distancing).  Our son learnt that the other boy actually lives nearby as well. My partner and I left the boys to it and told our son to wander home when he was ready. We had to end up going to get him to come in for dinner about 45 minutes later!It occurred to me that this interaction hadn't been happening in recent ""normal times"" - both boys likely would have been off in other parts of the region doing formal training sessions, or inside on screens whilst mum/dad were still at work or attending to other commitments.",story,,11,2020-03-25 02:08:00,"https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/children-kids-child-playmate-modern_childhood-fresh_air-mbcn4863_low.jpg?lighbox","https://twitter.com/uppy01",6,"-34.91909,138.50055",What people have done,Inclusive Language|Local Resources,Outdoor Activities
