"Football in the park","Last night we went out as a family to take our dog for a walk around the neighborhood. We finished up back at the local oval near our house. While there our 11 year oid son saw one of his mates from school kicking a football with his mum. He wandered over and the two boys started passing the ball and chatting (whilst always maintaining sufficient physical distancing).  Our son learnt that the other boy actually lives nearby as well. My partner and I left the boys to it and told our son to wander home when he was ready. We had to end up going to get him to come in for dinner about 45 minutes later!It occurred to me that this interaction hadn't been happening in recent ""normal times"" - both boys likely would have been off in other parts of the region doing formal training sessions, or inside on screens whilst mum/dad were still at work or attending to other commitments.","story","","11","2020-03-25 02:08:00","https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/children-kids-child-playmate-modern_childhood-fresh_air-mbcn4863_low.jpg?lighbox","https://twitter.com/uppy01","6","-34.91909,138.50055","What people have done","Inclusive Language|Local Resources","Outdoor Activities"
"Citizen driving the services not the services driving the citizen","I'd like to be able to share this particular story which is from my own perspective as a Community Builder to highlight the neighbourly response to a pandemic which consequently is stretching all the resources institutions, from the NHS to local authorities have:Due to a recent fall Alfred, a 74 year old local resident, is now under the care of adult social services, age UK and carers outsourced via public funds.Alfred reached out to a local neighbour, Adele, who had learned of his fall when Alfred called her from the hospital right before the pandemic swept conventional life under the carpet. Alfred asked Adele to reach out to a local authority initiative to make an exception for him one day when he had run out of food and money to support himself. Due to his recent fall Alfred's mobility is hugely adjusted and limited to what life was like prior to his fall so he asked the local initiative to make a delivery for him.The local charity delivering the initiative were happy to  make a ""one off"" exception for Alfred.Meanwhile Adele had prepared Alfred a lunch and a dinner for that day due to ongoing communication between the two neighbours Alfred and Adele. Adele was fully aware that carers had not been able to perform the functions requested of them by Alfred and the Council, regularly missing appointments and forgetting to clean, feed or talk to Alfred when they are with him.Adele meanwhile had asked her neighbour to transport her (Adele is disabled and her mobility is highly infringed consequently) to Iceland to pickup groceries for Alfred, Adele knew Alfred well and understood exactly what Alfred would like based on his predilections and on his current ability to use cutlery and culinary equipment.Adele arrived at Alfred's house from the local Iceland with her Neighbour. Alfred welcomed them in and showed Adele and her neighbour the food dropped off too him by the local charity offering the  councils food budget initiative. A welcome gift from the local charity, however Alfred referred to the butternut squash as a ""plum"" and explained that a lot of the fruit and veg he could not  prepare either because of his knowledge of that food or the practicality of using certain kitchen utensils for a man who now needs daily and frequent care. There was also tampons and pads left for Ray in the shopping by accident or perhaps there was another reason for now unknown,Adele placed the meal she had prepared for Alfred in the microwave so that when(if) Alfred's carer showed up in the evening that day when scheduled they would simply reheat the food and feed Ray. She gave Ray his lunch she had prepared for him and they spoke  about Alfred's care and how she'd like to keep him company and send her neighbours round if he felt comfortable with that.Alfred was pleased by Adele's thoughts and offered his shopping that he couldn't use to her. Alfred wanted to share with Adele two severe safeguarding concerns regarding the carers that are coming in: one, presumably, accidentally placed the bar of soap on a razor blade in Alfred's bathroom which had stuck deep into the soap of which Alfred (who was fortunate enough to notice, being part blind as well) was unable to remove from the soap. Alfred also has concerns about one carer who is rough with Alfred and causing bruises and pain to him after ""caring"".Alfred was once a carer in his time and he told Adele what he is  looking for from a carer organisation and this wasn't it.Adele knew her local community builder and explained to him that something needed to be done and that she had also been struck by an idea.Adele informed the local community builder that her neighbour had recently been laid off from her work and was struggling to make ends meet for her family under  the current national crisis. Adele had been supporting her neighbour but also this neighbour of hers, Mary, had been supporting Alfred too.Mary is a nurse at a care home, one day when Alfred had called Adele to explain he had tried to shower himself and his carer had not shown up that day he got himself into a spot of bother and needed some help. Adele had sent her neighbour Mary who helped Alfred and so began an informal neighbour to neighbour care and care receiver relationship.Adele told the community builder ""Why could the council not just pay Mary to be Alfred's carer/personal assistant during this time?""Adele had built a layer of support around Alfred, more expensive than any money could buy and that was neighbour to neighbour gift of the heart care during a time when Alfred would most need it.Adele, Alfred and Mary had successfully navigated a situation where Alfred now receives care from his neighbour of whom he trusts and is satisfied. His carer Mary now receives an income for her time and expertise to support her family, where previously she had lost her job due to the pandemic. Adele meanwhile established  a relationship between adult social services, her community builder, the local GP and her  neighbours in order to create clear open channels of communication to take action where needed for the local population of elderly, isolated and those with complex health care needs. This in order to respond at a hyper local level with effective decisive action and activity saving huge amounts of time, local resources and building friendships and partnerships moving forward.","story","","18","2020-03-25 18:35:06","","james.moore@cvalive.org.uk","5","51.34124,-0.00995","What people have done","Good Neighbours|Inclusive Language|Sharing of Perspectives|Local Resources|Strengths","Indoor Activities|Use of Technology"

"A small act of kindness","In my small remote community in northern Ontario, Canada, as community members followed the government advice to isolate in our homes fear set in with many seniors in our community leaving them afraid to leave their homes. Knowing this was happening, one individual posted to a local social media page offering to run errands for anyone who would prefer not to venture out at this time. He asked other to also to be proactive as well if they knew of any vulnerable people to call them regularly to check on how they are doing. He also asked people to share his contact information with anyone who may not be on social media. And it concluded with a suggestion that perhaps we need a town wide block party when this has passed.

"Spring in Springfield","This story starts on a street in Springfield in Wigan on Friday 13th March.  A couple of neighbours sensing that everyone may be asked to stay indoors decided to ask their neighbours if they would like to create a WhatsApp group and / or phone list to enable connection and support.  They made a flyer, and, observing physical distancing, chose to pop it through the door of all 43 houses in the street.  The flyer highlighted that there may be times when we need to accept help from others and also times when we could offer it.   It emphasised that we all have something to offer and that at the very least we could help each other with loo roll supplies.  The response was heart-warming, particularly from those who lived alone or were already self-isolating.  ""I was worried about what might happen if I become ill as I live on my own.  Now I feel reassured.  It's good to know you have support if you need it and you can give back when you are well,” said one young woman.  Adult children rang to say how relieved they were to know that someone would look out for their parents if they couldn't get to them. They chose to join the group offering their support to the street and knowing that they could take it if needed.  In no time at all we had worked together to explore connections and support networks by asking: Who are the neighbours who could be most affected by the virus?  What connections do they already have?  And, who from the street is already connected?  Neighbours then naturally took on roles. “We’ve been getting shopping for Dilys anyway so we’ll carry on looking after her, and if we get sick and have to stay in can someone else look out for her?”  “We have Phil & Audrey covered.  Alice loves listening to Phil’s stories so he’ll really help Alice cope with having to stay away from school and friends.” Almost two weeks later and the group is still forming with offers of shopping and the sharing of jokes.  We are still very much in the discovery stage, getting to know each other in a very new way and learning more about what we have.  Three nurses, an electrician, a builder and a couple of fitness instructors so far.  Five year old Alice has volunteered to entertain us all.  There’s a feeling of togetherness; of belonging.  We feel ready together.To follow…..The neighbours shared their story of street connection in the Wigan COVID 19 Mutual Aid Facebook group on the 15th March, along with an offer to support those who may want to develop a street based approach.  Emma, from Springfield got in touch.  She had set up a Facebook group named Springfield Supporters for residents who may want to help those who are self- isolating in the Springfield area.  By the 21st March, every home in 79 streets of Springfield had received personal invitations to street connect and a WhatsApp group of 24 street champions had been formed. As street champs, we have our first ‘Zoom and a brew or something stronger’ on the evening of the 26th March.  We don’t know where we are going but we’re going there together.We’ve also started conversations with the locality Council Manager. He could well be an ally.

"Surprise Virtual Birthday Party","Last Sunday was my husband's 59th birthday. Our initial plan was for our daughter to coordinate her visit to Chicago with his birthday and fly in from Denver. We invited several friends to join us at a quaint, but tightly seated local restaurant. Well, first we ended up cancelling my daughter's visit. Then a few days later we cancelled dinner reservations and arranged for our friends to join us in our home. Then.. we cancelled the home dinner. By Saturday evening we were in a state mandated ""stay at home"" order. Although my husband was disappointed, in the big picture, this was all a minor sacrifice. After having a successful coffee meeting via Zoom with friends two days before my husband's birthday, I decided to try to organize a surprise Happy Birthday Sing-a-long. I quickly emailed links to many friends and family. On Sunday evening, with cake at the ready I asked my husband to come help me with my computer.  Eighteen of our friends and family from our next door neighbors to those spread coast to coast were waiting on a Zoom call to yell, ""Surprise!!"" We all sang a rousing, if not quite in sync, version of the happy birthday song. We were on the call for less than half an hour. Not only was my husband's evening brightened, but we were able to brighten the evening not only for the few of us who would have spent the evening together, but for all 18 of our friends and family.","story","","32","2020-03-25 18:15:22","","","5.5","","What people have done","Inclusive Language|Strengths","Indoor Activities|Use of Technology"
"Hyper Localised Community Response","From the perspective of The Community Builder:In the face of physical distancing, encouraging people to stay indoors and especially for those who have health care needs or symptoms of COVID19 in a part of Croydon, neighbours have gone above and beyond the realms of possibilities for local authorities, institutions and Third Sector organisations.A residents association (NARA), originally set up to work with the social housing developer launching numerous projects in the area, had taken to Facebook to inform all its members (100) that they were setting up a hyper localised response to those who reach out and need food, medicines and water in this time of crisis.The call was made: ""all those potentially available to deliver leaflets to the residents of their streets please make yourselves please get in touch""Low and Behold 200 volunteers came forward in New  Addington and Fieldway to form a network of hyperlocalised leafletting. The leaflets had a contact line for the Residents Association to listen to those physically distancing for one reason or another to their thoughts, challenges and emergencies. The residents association had developed a centralised call line for the area and called on its volunteers to find out if anyone might like to step forward  as call handlers. These call handlers came forward in their masses and 5 call handlers are operating round a 24/7 basis daily.This hyper localised form of community response has grown in its numbers and capabilities. The residents association allocates the closest neighbour to the neighbour in need in order to create facilitate the safest and most hyper localised form of support, usually in the form of medicine or food deliveries. Neighbours in need mainly call the central helpline through the leafletting process. However after word got around about this community action through the residents group (NARA/New Addington Residents Associaton), adult social workers from the local council and local GP's with Social Prescribing Link Workers are now making direct referrals to the residents group led by citizens for citizens. Neighbours own and perform the initiative, led and co-owned by its volunteers they are in constant commuication through a vast whatsapp group constituting 250 members and rising.Meanwhile as cabinet ministers of the local  council learn of this ""fast and loose action"" taken by an constituted local group, they repeatedly assure colleagues and partners that institutional response is the safest, quickest way to respond to community crisis.Meanwhile the very same cabinet ministers are making referrals into the third sector partners, bypassing the institutional response they claimed was procedurally obligatory. These third sector partners, whose limitations also exist when it comes to hyper localised support and capacity, are handing these ""referrals"" or calls of help directly onto this ""fast and loose"" community group/residents association.This small hyper localised group are working in partnership with the Croydon COVID 19 Mutual Aid group who are rewriting the handbooks and records of speed of community action on a daily basis. They have 2000 members so far, will institutions wake up in time to realise they are supposed to be directing their resources through communities and citizen led action before its too late.","story","","33","2020-03-25 19:03:35","","07943 382 193 james.moore@cvalive.org.uk","-1","51.34124,-0.00995","What people would like to do","Good Neighbours|Inclusive Language|Sharing of Perspectives|Local Resources|Strengths","Outdoor Activities|Use of Technology"

"Using NextDoor and Facebook for community-wide conversations without risk","A couple of years ago our community of Carlton, Victoria, Australia received access to NextDoor www.nextdoor.com a social network which is place-specific. That is, whereas Facebook or Twitter can connect people equally well whether they are next door, or at opposite sides of the globe, NextDoor aims to connect all the people in a specific local area. For instance, when I go onto NextDoor, I can invite my friends and neighbours via email, or I have a 100 free postcards that I can send to their street addresses, to invite people I know.Till now, NextDoor has been filled with typical neighbour chatter: invites to events, complaints about noise, requests for help, yard sales, etc. However, since the pandemic took hold, the tenor of the conversation has changed completely. There have been a flood of offers to help grocery shop for the elderly, disabled, medically vulnerable, or anyone that can't get out of the house. Here's an example:""Here to help""""Hi neighbours. I know this is an uncertain time, so wanted to offer a helping hand. I’d be happy to run an errand for anyone who needs extra help. For example, I can leave groceries at your door.  Don’t hesitate to comment below or message me! And if you can offer help to neighbours in need, comment below with how.""Another:""Support your local businesses""""Dear All. During these difficult times please try to grab a coffee, or a potato cake, or a sandwich from a local business and help them keep the doors open. We can all still observe our social distancing requirements, and minimise our need to be outside whilst supporting local businesses at the same time. A lot of places are taking phone orders, and/or delivering. Even a small spend in these trying times will go a long way.""People also share information about the virus, and even the habitual complainers have focussed on social distancing. The NextDoor platform has also pitched in by building new features that they believe particularly useful for community organising in these trying times. These are described here: https://aublog.nextdoor.com/2020/03/22/nextdoor-launches-help-map-and-groups-to-bring-neighbours-together/Finally, the limit of NextDoor is that you can only access it if it has been rolled out in your area. However, if there is no NextDoor available, you can also replicate much of its function by setting up a Facebook Group for your community. Building a community conversation point via Facebook works well, and I am member of one in my old haunt: Wewak, in Papua New Guinea. In addition, an Australian not-for-profit has specialised in helping communities use Facebook to build community. You can read about their work here:""Good Karma Networks""""Helping people help each other.""""Good Karma Networks are suburb-specific online communities that provide members with the opportunity to connect, collaboratively solve problems and build relationships, therefore breaking down barriers and developing community resilience and resourcefulness.""http://www.goodkarmaeffect.com/networks.htmlhttp://www.goodkarmaeffect.com/about.html Just now, however, they are over over-stretched and underfunded, so building an online meeting place in your community will—as ever—depend on mobilising local talents and energies.","story","","37","2020-03-26 01:53:00","","davidweek@gmail.com","7.5","-37.8,144.96667","What people have done","Good Neighbours|Inclusive Language|Sharing of Perspectives|Local Resources|Strengths","Outdoor Activities|Use of Technology"
"Dinner Friends","For the past eight years our neighbourhood association has been offering up a tasty meal twice a month for anyone who can come. Typically one hundred folks come out. It is a space to connect with friends and get a nutritious meal, at no cost. We are not the only meal that is served in town and many folks really depend on the community dinners to get through the week. All of our meals are supported by a food redistribution program called Food for Life and many financial donations. The food and financial resources are all still available but of course we are not able to gather, so the meals all shut down. Our group worked out a plan to collaborate with another community dinner group that also didn't have the heart to stop cooking. Tonight we safely worked in shifts of 5 to cook and package meals (with lots of hand washing and attention to physical distancing) to make some delicious shepherds pies that will be distributed to our dinner friends across the city.  We are really pleased to have sort out this way to work together with partners and other volunteers from across the city to ensure people are eating well, collectively sharing some love through food.Although our purpose was to cook for others we all commented on how much we enjoyed the conversation while we worked. As one friend noted, we are all sorting out ways for virtually connecting, but this ""really felt like a break from being alone"".

"Street Exercise and Dance","At 11.00 a.m., a community in Dublin 8, come out on to their street to exercise. With most of the street working from home due to COVID-19, it started as an idea on the street WhatsApp and quickly gathered momentum. These neighbours, young and old, maintain physical distance while enjoying some light exercise. They are lucky to have a neighbour with a great gift - the gift of dance - who is a Director with the Dublin Youth Dance Company. She provides the music and the speakers and some light direction where needed. Some neighbours do their weight training during this time while others do some light yoga and stretches. The biggest benefit is the togetherness and its positive impact on mental health while people adjust to radical changes in how they live their lives.","story","","41","2020-03-26 11:37:41","https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/0318/1123786-street-exercise-dublin/","","4","53.33306,-6.24889","What people have done","Good Neighbours|Inclusive Language|Local Resources|Strengths","Outdoor Activities"
"Building a Neighborhood Connector's Core","I'm a young-ish working mother of a 2 year old who works in community development. My job right now focuses on a national project and consists mostly of coaching others in building community in their places. Since we moved here to Indianapolis, one of my greatest frustrations and longings has been around a need for community in my own neighborhood -- because it's my passion and because, as a new parent, I am feeling first-hand the burden of our culture of isolation and yearn for more relationships of exchange and ""mutual delight"" in our and our daughter's life. But while I have made efforts to gradually get to know my neighbors and connect us all together, it's been incredibly slow since I find myself unable to find the time and energy -- between work, cooking dinner, cleaning house, caring for our child and keeping up with family -- to put the time into it that I know it needs. So, my sense of palpable isolation has remained.But miraculously, over the last two weeks the growth of the COVID-19 viral threat has lit a fire under me. Despite new pressures like my husband and I needing to watch our daughter full time while also working (her daycare closed), the energy has just been there for me to get organizing. I began a couple of weeks ago by researching what other neighborhoods are doing and then reaching out to my neighbors to float the idea of creating some kind of mutual support network for each other to get through this together and especially to make sure our most vulnerable are taken care of. Everyone I talked to said it sounded great, but no one at first stepped up to say they'd help. I was a bit more direct with some Moms I've gotten to know, and they shared candidly that they just didn't have the time or headspace right now with the support their families needed... but two suggested their husbands may be interested. So I asked them. Another couple who recently moved in serves on the neighborhood association board... so I listened to my gut and asked the wife. All said yes!So, we are currently in the ""building"" phase of this, but personally for me even this first coming together of energy around a more connected, mutually supportive neighborhood is a huge first step. The urgency, and perhaps the global nature of this pandemic has pushed me to make more direct asks to learn who among those folks I know share my passion, and to be bolder than I may have been otherwise in inviting them to join me to make something real together.At this point, I've taken the time to speak with each on the phone -- first to check in and see how they're doing -- and then to brainstorm a bit about the idea. I've been mindful not to make this about me, or what kind of structure I think we should use... but to try and open up a space where their own experience and ideas are just as important as mine. I know I cannot and don't want to be ""the leader"" of this, since i do have a full-time job (and a young child), and it's not something I or anyone is getting paid for. Through these conversations, I've been delighted at the ideas and considerations each person has offered up. One was a suggestion that we split the neighborhood into quadrants and just take on our own quadrant for now so as to not overwhelm ourselves and make this effort more appealing for neighbors... turns out this is something the neighborhood association has already been thinking. So I guess I'd call this the ""building of a core."" We are planning to meet in the next few days on Zoom to brainstorm together and come up with a plan that sounds good to all. So far, each person has agreed we think of this as community building BEYOND the crisis... something we want to keep growing when we're on the other end of it. We also want to find a way of connecting us all that uses technology wisely -- i.e. a platform that most people can access (including our Elders) and that will allow people to talk with and perhaps form collaborations with each other easily while not overwhelming anyone's phone. As this small group has been gradually forming, I've simultaneously begun trying to create even smaller structures of communication and exchange with the neighbors MOST immediately around me via a text thread I sent the other day when my husband and I were headed to the grocery store. I was honestly quite nervous about doing it, but in the spirit of boldness and experimentation, I wrote the 5 most immediate neighbors around our house and asked if anyone would like anything from the store (explaining that I'd read this is a good strategy among neighbors so fewer of us need to get exposed to public places.) One neighbor asked to be taken off the thread but in a very nice way... and I thanked him for his honesty and began a new thread, asking everyone to use that one. Everyone thanked me, and one asked me to grab her some dried mango. This same neighbor then offered to do the same for any of us when she goest in to her job at a huge grocery store on Thursdays! This seemed to me like a great connection for us all to have... ""someone on the inside!"" Another neighbor on the thread who seems to have the gift of neighborhood protectiveness has since been communicating on the thread about things he notices around us that concern him, and as a group we've been troubleshooting each one. One such case was a U-Haul that had been parked just north of us on the street for several days -- an occurrence he noted seems to happen every few months. (I'm NOT much of a ""neighborhood watch"" type, so I was completely oblivious to this!) As a group, we shared knowledge about this and through this, one neighbor took action and we solved the case -- it had been reserved through U-Haul and never turned in, and the company would come and pick it up ASAP. I was able to update the neighbor who'd been asked to be taken off the list, and he was delighted as well.Finally, as mostly new arrivals in a community that is racially and economically mixed (and gentrifying), one of my priorities -- which the core of connectors each agreed should be our shared priority -- is that any larger effort should be respectful of and in good relationship with those neighbors who have been here for many years and may already be actively connected to one another. None of us knows the best way to do this but it's a question we want to explore together. In my own sense of urgency around this question, I sought out a colleague of mine last week who has been a long-time community builder working for many years alongside the neighbors here, mostly in the southern part of the neighborhood and many of them lower income folks of color. He is an expert at avoiding the many false and harmful assumptions in our country and our community around people of color, and he is a brilliant innovator in and actively challenging these assumptions by focusing his work on shining a light on and finding ways to support and invest in folks' capacities, gifts and contributions to their neighbors' lives. Having seen a lot of ""white do-gooder"" efforts targeting the neighborhood as well as white-led neighborhood groups in action, he encouraged me to simply seek to see and notice how those with fewer means are responding to this crisis and helping each other out. He also named some connectors he knows who are doing this actively each day in this neighborhood. So as I work with the neighbors it's been easiest for me to join forces with in my immediate surrounding, I also plan to reach out to these connectors and learn from them, while trying to find openings and opportunities for us to perhaps bridge these ""two neighborhoods"" through simple relationship-building, seeing and sharing gifts, and hopefully some wonderful in-person parties, meals and projects once we are on the other side of this pandemic.For the first time in a long time, I am feeling like a whole person. This crisis has fully activated my passion and need for immediate neighborhood connectedness and to be actively building it around me -- not just ""for others"" or some theoretical idea of ""building community,"" but also because my life cries out for it every single day. And as the scary, sad and horrific news articles pour in, I feel like in a way I've been vaccinated and am safe from the feelings of powerlessness this kind of news often provokes in one's mind and soul. I see the willingness to do, care and share emerging around me from within my neighbors and I know that, no matter how much any of us may struggle or suffer, we will find a way forward together.","story","","43","2020-03-26 15:55:41","","aprildoner@gmail.com","7","","What people have done","Good Neighbours|Inclusive Language|Sharing of Perspectives|Local Resources|Strengths","Indoor Activities|Use of Technology"
"suppliers of sustenance","I’ve just come back from my daily dose of exercise and outdoor time in the otherwise lock down conditions we are currently facing here in the UK. It’s perhaps the first time in living memory that I’ve ran through local streets and been met with a welcoming smile from every single person I passed, at my safe distance of 2m. That outpouring of neighbourliness and the feeling it bestows is perhaps best exemplified by the lovely image attached that I captured on my run. However, the revelation I wanted to share today was to come when I dropped down to run along the local riverside and was met with a pungent seasonal smell. You see, spring has finally sprung here and the local farmers have wasted no time in fertilising their fields with stocks of manure that have been held in safe storage through the winter months. It was at once an act of such normality that it gave me an immediate sense of calm, and also such a novel experience in my current frame of mind that it stirred me. Having been jolted into the present by such an arresting aroma, I found myself reflecting on what I might do to support the local farming community at this time of crisis and how we might all wish, going forward, to relearn our relationship with the suppliers of sustenance who live on our doorstep.I wonder if we might have the opportunity in the weeks and months ahead to reimagine what it means to be rooted in your locale. Might we find ways to reconnect with local food producers to feed ourselves in ways that confer strength and immunity to both ourselves and our communities.
